# Crowdfunding-ETL

In this project, both an ETL process and data analysis using SQL were performed. Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks were all utilized to perform the extract and transform phases. After that, clean data were exported into different CSV files. Then, a database diagram was created to illustrate the ERD of the data using QuickDBD.com. Finally, POSTGRESQL was used to perform SQL analysis on the data and export the desired final output.
